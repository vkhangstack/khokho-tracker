# Daily Sleep Tracker


A CRD (the "U" wasn't needed in this app, but I commented the update code in the file in case anyone else needs some inspiration) app that serves the function of being a Daily Sleep Tracker. The technologies used are the following:

- React (with Hooks, Context & Router)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- TailwindCSS (including Dark Mode and custom classes & functions)
- GSAP for animations
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Firestore Database
- React-Vis (for graph)
- Moment time plugin (for turning time decimals -> hh:mm format)

To be added:
 - ~~Footer~~
 - ~~About page with additional GSAP animations~~
 - ~~Stats Dashboard rework~~
 - ~~Responsive Dashboard page~~
 - Remember me & forgot password Authentication implementation
 - QoL changes
